HOW TO PLAY SWF FILES AFTER FLASH DIED
--------------------------------------
Download and install Flashpoint from https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/downloads/. I recommend Flashpoint Infinity, as it takes up less space (much less space). After that, you can search for any Flash game (including HTML5 and other platforms like Shockwave), including the Flipline games. After you start any game, you can just click "Open" on the top left corner and choose the game .swf that came with this .zip file.

Have fun! :)
